KATANA NINJA - REQUIRED AUDIO ASSETS
=====================================

Based on the game code analysis, here are the audio assets that would enhance the game experience:

SOUND EFFECTS:
--------------
1. slice_fruit.wav/mp3 - Sound when slicing fruits (multiple variations: slice_fruit_1, slice_fruit_2, slice_fruit_3)
2. bomb_explosion.wav/mp3 - Sound when hitting a bomb (game over)
3. combo_hit.wav/mp3 - Special sound for combo multipliers
4. whoosh.wav/mp3 - Sound for slice/swipe motion
5. fruit_miss.wav/mp3 - Sound when fruit falls off screen (lose life)
6. button_click.wav/mp3 - UI button interaction sounds
7. button_hover.wav/mp3 - UI button hover sounds
8. game_over.wav/mp3 - Game over sound effect
9. new_high_score.wav/mp3 - Celebration sound for new high score

BACKGROUND MUSIC:
----------------
1. menu_music.mp3 - Background music for menu scene (looping)
2. game_music.mp3 - Background music for gameplay (looping, energetic)
3. game_over_music.mp3 - Background music for game over scene

NOTES:
------
- All audio files should be in common web formats (MP3, WAV, OGG)
- Keep file sizes reasonable for web loading
- Consider volume levels and audio balancing
- The game currently uses programmatically generated graphics, so audio would significantly enhance the user experience
- Audio integration would require adding Phaser audio calls to the existing game scenes
